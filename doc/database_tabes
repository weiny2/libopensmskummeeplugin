Database Design is described in this document.

The database is modeled after the type of data OpenSM is going to provide
through the event interface.

The initial DB was set up to have a single entry of all the port data
counters and port error counters.

The 2.0 version of the DB strives to collect more information that this.  I
would like to know more about what the port is connected to (link and remote
port info) as well as collecting historical data.


The Node table can stay the same.

Table node
nodeguid, name, type, timestamp

I think we need a new table Port.

Table port
nodeguid, portnum, portguid, remoteportguid, timestamp


   [What happens when ports/nodes leave the fabric?  How do we record this?
   Should there be an enter/leave marker on the entries?]


Port information tables based on the collection information.  There will be
multiple entries in each table for each portguid.  timestamp gives us the
history of what has happened with the cluster.

Table porterrors
portguid, ... error counters ..., timestamp

Table portcounters
portguid, ... counters ..., timestamp

Table portselect
portguid, ... select counters ..., timestamp

Table portinfo
portguid, ... port info ..., timestamp
