Installing this package requires a few manual steps...

After the install do the following.

1) Set the user/password for the mysql DB in the file:
   /etc/libopensmskummee.conf
   This allows the plugin (in OpenSM) and install scripts to connect to MySQL.

2) Create the MySQL DB for the plugin.  (If you don't have a MySQL installed
   see that documentation for more information.  http://www.mysql.com/)

   2a) connect to your mysql db and run the following command.
      create database opensmskummeedata;
   2b) from a prompt run (as root or another user with MySQL connectivity.)
      $ opensmskummee_create_db.pl

If you are _NOT_ using SKUMMEE and just want MySQL data skip to step 4

3) If you _ARE_ using SKUMMEE configure it.
   (see: https://sourceforge.net/projects/skummee for more information)

   Run [*]:
   $ chown :<skummee_user> /etc/libopensmskummee.conf

   Consult Jeff regarding set up of SKUMMEE nodes.  Hopefully we will get back
   to being automated in the future.

      [*] Where <skummee_user> is the user under which skummee runs.

4) And finally turn it on in OpenSM.

   edit the opensm.opts file
   # enable perfmgr
   perfmgr TRUE
   # point OpenSM to this plugin
   event_plugin_name opensmskummeeplugin

5) Restart opensm 

   $ /etc/init.d/opensmd restart

6) Wait at least 1 sweep time period.  (Default 180 Sec)

7) verify that data is being entered into the DB.

   $ opensmskummeequery -R
